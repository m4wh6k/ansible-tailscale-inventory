# Contributing to ansible-tailscale-inventory

Contributions are welcomed! Please feel free to [submit
issues](https://github.com/m4wh6k/ansible-tailscale-inventory/issues) and propose fixes and changes to the script.

## Development dependencies

- `make`
- `python` 3.8 or higher

Running `make dev` will install more pip dependencies.

## Formatting & Linting

Code is expected to formatted and type annotated to conform with `mypy`, and `ruff`. Formatting can be tested with `make
test`. Some formatting can be automatically applied by running `make fmt`.

## Testing

We use `pytest` to ensure the script works as expected as we change things. Simply running `pytest` with no arguments
will test the script. Or, you can run `make test` to run the full test suite with linting.

Pytests can be found in the `tests/` dir. The main existing test simply checks that a given Tailscale status output will
produce an Ansible inventory in an expected format. The expected inputs and outputs are defined in `tests/mock_data.py`.

For most inventory structure changes it should be adequate to simply update the input and output data structures in
`tests/mock_data.py`. A recommended development workflow is to update the mock data and then start updating the script
to produce the expected output, running `pytest` along the way until it passes.

A GitHub Actions workflow will test changes on Pull Request. It can also be run on-demand against branches. The GH
Actions workflow will run tests using multiple versions of python to ensure the script remains compatible.
